        <h1>Places for my summer vacation in Portland (๑ˇεˇ๑)</h1>
            <p>Here are some places I have thought for my summer vacation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Forest Park</li>
                    <li>Oregon Zoo</li>

                </ul>
            <h2>Forrest Park</h2>
                <p>At 5,200 acres, Portland’s Forest Park is one of the largest urban forests in the United States. With more than 80 miles of trails, fire lanes and forest roads, Forest Park stretches for more than seven miles along the eastern slope of the Tualatin Mountains, overlooking Northwest Portland and the convergence of the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. Forest Park offers an unparalleled opportunity for visitors to experience a true Northwest forest without leaving the Portland city limits.</p>
